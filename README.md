# multipagewebsiteCICD
Denis personal multipage website CICD with githubactions


Overview Of what's required 

A GitHub repository with my personal website files (index.html, etc.)

An AWS S3 bucket already configured for static website hosting

An IAM user with access to that bucket (for GitHub Actions)

GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to deploy to the AWS S3 Bucket on push

Step 1 I created  an IAM user for Github Actions.

 Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key and we will save them on github later on.

 Save the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key — you’ll need them in GitHub.

 2. Then add services to your Github Repo in your Github repository.

Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret

3. Then we Added a GitHub Actions Workflow File

and a deploy.yml

4. Test It
 We test the Github Acitions Pipeline by pushing changes made to the main branch
(e.g., edit a line in index.html)


Go to the Actions tab on GitHub → you’ll see the workflow running

Visit your website — it should reflect the changes automatically!

Website changes reflected on S3 bucket and live website.


**Add CloudFront Invalidation**

Since we added CloudFront which is a global cache that sits in front of the S3 Bucket, including an invalidation step to the CI/CD pipeline will guarantee our visitors always see the freshly
deployed and updated files instead of whatever is sitting in the edge caches.

1. Get your CloudFront Distribution ID

2. Copy the Distribution ID 

Pasted the Distribution ID onto GitHub Secrets

3. then updated my deploy.yml:

4. After deploying your files to S3, the .yml tells CloudFront to clear its cache and then tells CloudFront to pull the latest version of our site from S3

5. Once set up we pushed a change to our master branch

and received an Error.

![alt text](<Bilder/Screenshot (280).png>)
![alt text](<Bilder/Screenshot (281).png>)

6. that error was as a result of my IAM user (github-actions-deploy) doesn’t have permission to invalidate CloudFront distributions.

7. Solution: I needed to attach a Permission to my (github-actions-deploy) IAM Policy

attach an inline policy

8. Named the policy: AllowCloudFrontInvalidation

9. Push a small change to your master branch (even just a space) to trigger the workflow again.
This time it should

10. Work. Success. CloudFront cache invalidated and my Website changes wer reflected.

11. But had an issue that rendered my index.html or the website to be inaccessible after i pushed abunch of changes to Github.

12. I tried to Trouble Shoot The Issue (Check Blog) I wrote about this issue

Checked S3 Bucket Policy & Permissions to see if Bucket policy allows public s3:GetObject on all objects but we didn't want full public access on the s3 Bucket.

13. CloudFront Configuration see as it's the first line of defence.

"Note" If you serve via CloudFront with Origin Access Control (OAC) or Origin Access Identity (OAI), ensure your S3 bucket policy grants access to CloudFront’s identity, not public.

14. My goal is to have a public website behind CloudFront, keep Block Public Access on the S3 Bucket ON and configure the bucket policy to allow only CloudFront access.

15. So i ensuredb CloudFront Used Origin Access Control (OAC) create a CloudFront Origin Access Control confirm it's attached to my distribution

16. and i am able to push changes to AWS S3 via github actions and my website is visible and updates the changes pushed.
